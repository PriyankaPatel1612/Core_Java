-->Thread
Thread is light weight process

-->Multithreading
Capability of a system to execute mutliple threads simultaneously is called multithreading.

-->Runnable (interface)

-->Thread (class)
child of runnable

-->public void run()       //method
if we want to create or run thread then we have to use this method
why we should use this?
because it is defined in interface, and all the defined method in interface are abstract. so that we have to defined in method.

-->Methods of thread class
public static Thread currentThread()     //shows current running thread
public void setName(String name)
public String getName()
public void setPriority(int p)         //1 to 10
public int getPriority()    
boolean isAlive()        //
public static void sleep(long miliseconds)throws IntrruptedException
public void join()throws IntrruptedExecution
public void run()          //running state
public void start()         //runnable state

-->Variables in thread class
public static final int  MIN_PRIORITY =1;
public static final int  MAX_PRIORITY =10;
public static final int  NORM_PRIORITY =1;

-->Synchronizaton
It is a process to lock the state of thread
It means that the thread will not share its resources with any other thread until it termination
Two ways to achieve synchronization
1)Synchronize block/object
2)Method synchronized
