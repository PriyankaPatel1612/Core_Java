#Class,Object and Instance variable

Variable
-->Local
      variable which declared inside the method are local variable.
-->Instance(or, non-static variable) /Class(or, static variable) 
      variable declared inside the class can be instance or static variable/class variable.

      case1: instance variable/ non-satic variable
      A variable is said to be instance when it is declared inside the class.
      case2: class variable/static variable
      A variable is said to be static or class when it is declared inside the class or static keyword
is written before variable.

Points to note:
-->we cannot access instance variable in method without creating object.
-->case1: because in java main method is static, and static method can only access static variables without object.
     case2: when we are declaring instance variable inside the class then the memory is not allocated, for allocating memory to the instance variable we have to create object.
-->to access instance or non-static variable we have to create object.

Object
-->In java a variable of class type is called a reference.
     example: Test t1;                //t1 is reference (memory not allocated, to allocate memory we have to create object)
-->In cpp constructor called automatically by creating object but,
      In java we have to create an object and call constructor
      example: Test t1 = new Test();   //t1 is object(memory is allocated, new keyword allocates the memory)
